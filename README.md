PineCoders is a [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/)-supported group of programmers using TradingView's [Pine Script](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/Introduction.html) programming language. We help TV members learn Pine, provide tools and resources for beginning as well as pro coders, and collaborate with TradingView to make using Pine indicators and strategies easier for both coders and the at-large TV community.

The [Suggestions For Improvement To Pine](https://trello.com/b/Jmv6c8Cx) Trello board is co-managed by PineCoders and TradingView. This [card](https://trello.com/c/r0jKAKhK) explains how the board works, how any Trello user can comment and vote on suggestions, or contribute new ones.

We also pilot the [PineCoders](https://www.tradingview.com/u/PineCoders/#published-scripts) TV moderator account, from which we moderate script publications, answer questions in the [Pine Script TV chat](https://www.tradingview.com/chat/#BfmVowG1TZkKO235), publish [open source tools and examples in Pine](https://www.tradingview.com/u/PineCoders/#published-scripts), and follow [leading publishers](https://www.tradingview.com/u/PineCoders/#following-people) of open source scripts on TV, who's code you can learn a great deal from. We also answer questions on Pine at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pine-script?sort=Newest).

PineCoders works daily with TradingView's Pine team to identify and validate anomalies, and test upcoming new features.

Our managed [PineCoders Repository](https://github.com/pinecoders/pine-utils) on GitHub contains:
- [Snippets](https://github.com/pinecoders/pine-utils/tree/master/snippets) of reusable code
- Tricks and techniques to help you accomplish frequently needed tasks
